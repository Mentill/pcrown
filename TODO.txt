Game plan for english text:
---------------------------
 cwx: -Disassemble and rebuild original 0.bin code along with relocation table. This is pretty much done, just need to redo the original patches.
 cwx: -Insert item descriptions, names, etc. contained in 0.bin
       -Need to rework insertion in a way so I can get everything fitting in ram. Do I even have enough space?
 cwx: -Issues with font generation:
  -Currently the font width has to be a multiple of 2 or character gets clipped, Need to figure out a way around this
   -Need to think how I want to handle odd offsets. Either the initial render to a temp buffer has to offset +1 or
    final buffer write has to offset. It might be easier to do former.
   -The way x offset is calculated is based on byte increment. Need a leftover variable that stores the odd offset
   -choice querry is current limited to fixed width(8 pixels). Need a better solution for this
   -After writing character, figure out offset of pixel we'll then use or operation on next write
   -May have to use ROTR, etc. to put the bits in the correct position. It's something to look into anyways
  -The font we're using(Courier New) is actually a fixed width font. Kind of defeats the purpose of vwf. Will have to fix.
  -Most fonts end up being either too tall or too wide. Is there a solution? 
   -I had a utility that was given to me that basically makes solving the problem easy. Can't remember name of it, need to look through my stuff or else ask on #yabause again.
 -Translate/Insert save selection menu.
 -Dump/Translate/Insert Town names(Each character drawn as sprite. Actual text in COMM.PAK, stored as a 0xC byte size structure. first two bytes is character? Town names all have 0x4XXX values)
 -Dump/Translate/Insert room names(stored as sprites in files like CAVE.CHR, DG1C.CHR, etc. Need to figure out how to dump)
 -Dump some misc text that hasn't been found yet:
  -150_00_1 has some text that isn't being dumped correctly. See "<CC03EC>ÉR<pause>"
 -Translate/Insert battle enemy names(All stored in the *.PRG files as plain ascii text. "KUWEIN" is in CARD.PRG for instance.)
 -Insert intro engrish(graphics stored in FONT.CHR. Text in plain ascii in 0.BIN starting at offset 0xACC85)
 cafe_alpha:-Insert another intro screen before Atlus logo to identify who did the translation
 -Adjust copyright text under Princess Crown logo to include our copyright
 -Supposedly there's a bug in the original game in a certain room.
 -Adapt patch for Satakore version. Not really a priority until we get basic translation done.
 -Use something better for applying the final patch. Maybe adapt the cd tools + patching into one tool. 
 
Other: 
------
 -Figure out a way of loading whatever script/graphics data I want in Yabause. Refer to _EVNLoadDataSelection in ram dumps
 -We will likely need to rework compression scheme. If we do however, all the control codes will also have to be reworked. 
  Maybe initially use the old scheme to verify everything else is working, then rework so that all text/control codes/decompress
  schemes, etc. use 1 byte instead of 2 for each set of data.
