# Princess Crown Translation Redux

[old readme here](readme.txt.old)

My attempt to restart the CyberWarriorX translation project.

Current status:

 - story events patching works using a fixed-size font, word wrapping still needs reworking
 - items and names translation TBA soon
 - needs testing for crashes
 
Issues, PRs and discussions are currently restricted to contributors.
