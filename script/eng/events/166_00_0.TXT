<CC03EA><color=0006><string=001C><lineend><color=0001>One big problem is that the goats love the grass that grows in the Forest of Bewilderment.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>We have to be extra careful to keep them away from there.<pause><lineend>|

<CC03EA><color=0006><string=0028><lineend><color=0005>The forest outside the village<color=0001> is called the <color=0002>Forest of Bewilderment.<color=0001><pause><lineend><CC03EA>There's a monster deep within it that uses illusions to make people lose their way.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>Once I went into it by accident, and I barely made it back out.<pause><lineend><CC03EA>Of course, the Unicorn's forest to the east is completely different.<pause><lineend>|
